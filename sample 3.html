 <h3> Explained in criticism & lawsuit debate over coding for kids</h3>
<h4>(i) why is learning to code a big deal ?</h4>
<p>At the turn of the century, when extremely affordable computers made their way into technical and engineering colleges across the country India was able to produce a huge Army of quarters and programmer essentially people who could create computer software as computer devices have taken over every aspect of life the need for good programmers and powders has been increasing at relentlessly and cause to teach coding and programming to your students have got louder in recent years platforms and companies have started to clan that kids as young as those in elementary school must begin to learn coding</p>
